### This Python project helps you parse and extract useful information from email addresses.

## How it Works ?

The Email Slicer takes an email address as input and slices it into three parts :

- Username: The part of the email address before the '@' symbol.
- Domain: The domain name where the email is hosted.
- Top-Level Domain (TLD): The last part of the email address (e.g., '.com', '.org', '.edu').
